    participant N3 as Node 3

    C->>N1: Write Request
    N1-->>C: Acknowledge

    Note over N1,N3: Asynchronous Replication
    N1->>N2: Replicate Data
    N1->>N3: Replicate Data

    Note over N1,N3: Eventually Consistent
```

## 🛠️ Performance Optimization Techniques

### Caching Strategies

| Strategy          | Use Case           | Pros               | Cons                   |

| **Cache-Aside**   | General purpose    | Simple, flexible   | Cache misses penalty   |
| **Write-Through** | Strong consistency | Data safety        | Higher latency         |
| **Write-Behind**  | High write load    | Better performance | Data loss risk         |
| **Refresh-Ahead** | Predictable access | Always fresh       | Complex implementation |

    }

    class Immutable {
        +final fields
        +no setters
        +thread-safe by design
    }

    class Synchronized {
        +synchronized methods
        +synchronized blocks
        +mutual exclusion
