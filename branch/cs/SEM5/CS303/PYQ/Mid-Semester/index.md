| **Question** | **Details**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | **Marks** |
| :-----------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------: |
| **1(a)** | With a neat sketch draw the **process state diagram**, explain various states the process may undergo from its creation to its termination. Mark all possible transitions and states and clearly explain the details of states and state-transitions. | 5 |
| **1(b)** | What is the **difference between a process and a thread**? | 2 |
| **1(c)** | Explain **what happens when a program makes a system call**. | 3 |
| **2(a)** | Consider the following page reference string: <br>`7, 2, 3, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7, 7, 1, 0, 5, 4, 6, 2, 3, 0, 1`. <br>Assume **demand paging** with **3 frames**. How many **page faults** would occur for the following replacement algorithms? Show your work. <br> - LRU replacement <br> - FIFO replacement <br> - Optimal replacement | 6 |
| **2(b)** | Mention the various **parameters (criteria)** considered for **CPU scheduling**. | 4 |
| **3(a)** | Define the term **race condition**. What is the key to avoid race conditions? | 3 |
| **3(b)** | Why can't a **single lock variable** guarantee mutual exclusion? How does **TestAndSet()** achieve this? | 3 |
| **3(c)** | Name the **four necessary conditions** for a **deadlock** to hold. What is the approach commonly used to prevent each condition? | 4 |
| **4(a)** | What is **TLB**? What is the **usage** of TLB? | 2 |
| **4(b)** | Show the **process of paging** (conversion of logical address to physical address) with **TLBs** using neat diagram. | 4 |
| **4(c)** | What is a **page fault**? With appropriate diagram, clearly discuss the **steps involved in handling the page fault** by an operating system. | 4 |
| **5(a)** | Explain **SCAN disk scheduling algorithm**. | 5 |
| **5(b)** | What are the **advantages of the variant of linked allocation** that uses a **FAT** to chain together the blocks of a file? | 5 |
| **6(a)** | Consider a **32-bit machine** with a **multi-level virtual memory system** with 32-bit pointers and 4096 byte pages that supports **two levels of paging**. All Page Table Entries (PTEs) are 4 bytes. Answer the following: <br> - Show the complete format of a **virtual address**. <br> - How many **memory operations** are required to read or write a single 32-bit word? <br> - List the **fields of a Page Table Entry (PTE)**. | 5 |
| **6(b)** | Write a **C program** to create a **child process** from its parent. Once the child process is created, immediately replace the binary image of the child process with a different task of your choice. Include all required header files and documentation. Use **fork()** and **exec()** system calls. | 5 |
