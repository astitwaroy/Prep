**Notes**

- If these folders don't exist yet in the repo, I can create them and add a placeholder `README.md` in each.
- To link lab manuals or experiment PDFs here, place files under `branch/cs/SEM5/labs/<LabFolder>/` (or inside `branch/cs/SEM5/<LabFolder>/`) and I'll add direct links.

## Resources & Checklist

- [ ] Add real PYQ PDFs under `PYQs/` (one folder per subject)
- [ ] Add lab manuals / sample code under `branch/cs/SEM5/` (e.g., `labs/`, `code/`)
- [ ] Add short README files inside each subject folder explaining naming conventions

---

## How to contribute

- To add a PYQ: create `PYQs/<Subject>/` and name files like `Subject_Mid_YYYY.pdf`.
- To link a PDF here, paste a relative link (e.g., `[CS301 Mid 2024](./PYQs/CS301/CS301_Mid_2024.pdf)`).
- If you want me to create the lab folders and placeholders now, say "create SEM5 lab folders" and I'll add them.
