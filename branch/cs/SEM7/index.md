## How to contribute

- To add a PYQ: create `PYQs/<Subject>/` and name files like `Subject_Mid_YYYY.pdf`.
- To link a PDF here, paste a relative link (e.g., `[CS401 Mid 2024](./PYQs/CS401/CS401_Mid_2024.pdf)`).
- If you want me to scan the repo and populate PYQ links, say "scan and populate" and I'll search and add links automatically.
