# 💼 Interview Experience – Fanatics SDE

**Type:** On-Campus Opportunity  
**Role:** Software Development Engineer (SDE)  
**Total Rounds:** 2 (Technical + Leadership/HR)

---

## ⚙️ Round 1 – Technical (DSA + Resume Discussion)

The interview started with a short introduction where I shared my background, current studies, and technical interests. After that, the interviewer moved on to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** questions. I was asked to code in **Java**.

### 🧩 Coding Questions

**1️⃣ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**  
> “Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.”

I began by explaining the **brute force approach**, discussed its **time complexity**, and pointed out its limitations. Then I optimized the solution using the **two-pointer (sliding window)** method.  
I implemented the complete code efficiently within **8–10 minutes**, explained the logic clearly, and verified it with multiple test cases.

**2️⃣ Book Dependency Problem (Topological Sort)**  
> “You are given a list of book dependencies — pairs `(a, b)` meaning: to read book `b`, you must first read book `a`.  
> Find a valid order of reading all books such that dependencies are satisfied. If no such order exists (i.e., there’s a cycle), print that it’s impossible.”

I started with the **BFS-based Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm)**, explained the intuition behind it, and implemented it successfully.  
The interviewer then asked me to implement the **DFS-based Topological Sort** as well.  
I explained **cycle detection** in DFS and validated my code with the interviewer’s test cases, all passed correctly.

### 💻 Resume & Technical Questions

Once the DSA part was complete, the interviewer discussed my **resume projects and technologies**. Questions included:  
- Concept of **WebSockets** and their role in real-time applications  
- Working of **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** in authentication  
- Use and intuition behind **LSTM networks** (from one of my ML projects)  
- **DBMS fundamentals**, mainly normalization and indexing  

The round lasted about **50 minutes**, balancing problem-solving and conceptual clarity.

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 1

## 🗣️ Round 2 – Leadership / HR Round

This round focused on **leadership qualities**, **communication**, and **team collaboration**.

It began with a short introduction, followed by typical HR questions like:  
- “Why do you want to join our company?”  
- “What do you know about our work culture and products?”

Then the interviewer shifted to my **team project experiences**, asking case-based questions such as:  
- How I handled **conflicts or disagreements** in a team  
- How **tasks and deadlines** were managed  
- What my **unique contributions** were  
- What I **learned** through the process  

The round lasted about **45 minutes** and primarily assessed **teamwork**, **leadership**, and **ownership mindset**.

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 2

## 🌟 Overall Experience

The entire process was **smooth and interactive**.  
The interviewers were friendly and encouraged me to explain my thought process at every step.

My key takeaways were:  
- Explain your **approach clearly before coding**  
- Stay **confident** during technical discussions  
- Always **back up your resume points** with real understanding

## 💡 Advice for Others

- **Focus on DSA & Competitive Programming (CP):**  
  Practice regularly on platforms like **Codeforces**, **CodeChef**, or **LeetCode**.  
  CP sharpens your problem-solving speed, logic, and pattern recognition, exactly what interviewers look for.

- **Build and Understand Projects:**  
  Don’t just build projects for your resume, understand how they work end-to-end.  
  Know your **APIs, databases, and authentication flows** well enough to discuss them confidently.
