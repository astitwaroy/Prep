# 💼 Interview Experience – Fanatics Intern + FTE

**Type:** On-Campus Opportunity  
**Role:** Software Development Engineer Intern + Full-Time (FTE)  
**Total Rounds:** 3 (Online Assessment + Technical + HR)

---

## 🧮 Round 1 – Online Assessment (HackerRank)

The first round was an **online coding assessment** conducted on **HackerRank**.  
It consisted of standard **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems testing logic, problem-solving ability, and time efficiency.  
This round served as the **shortlisting stage** for the technical interviews that followed.

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 1

---

## ⚙️ Round 2 – Technical Interview

In this round, I was asked **two medium-level DSA questions**, both focused on logic building and implementation.  

### 🧩 Coding Questions  

**1️⃣ Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**  
I began with the brute force explanation and discussed its limitations. Then I optimized the solution using the **two-pointer (sliding window)** technique.  
I wrote the code efficiently in **Java**, explained each step clearly, and ran test cases to verify correctness.  

**2️⃣ Three Sum Problem**  
Next, I was asked to find all unique triplets in an array that sum to zero.  
I approached it using **sorting + two-pointer** logic to reduce complexity from `O(n³)` to `O(n²)`.  
After implementation, I discussed edge cases and handling duplicates.

### 💻 Resume & Project Discussion  

Once the coding questions were done, the interviewer asked about my **projects, internship, and tech stack**.  
They focused on:  
- How my **projects** were built and the **challenges** I faced  
- My **internship learnings** and technical responsibilities  
- Technologies I used, especially in **backend and APIs**  

Overall, the round balanced **DSA**, **resume understanding**, and **technical communication**.  

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 2

## 🗣️ Round 3 – HR / Discussion Round

This was a **conversational and personality-based round** that started with my **introduction** — which played a major role here.  
The interviewer then discussed:  
- My **projects** and how I contributed individually  
- **Hackathons** I had participated in  
- My **internship experience** and what I learned from it  

After that, a few behavioral questions were asked:  
- “How do you handle team conflicts?”  
- “What’s your approach when deadlines are tight?”  
- “Why do you want to join Fanatics?”  

I explained how I value Fanatics’ work in **sports merchandise and tech-driven e-commerce**, and how it aligns with my interest in building impactful systems.  
The interviewer encouraged me to share my genuine thoughts and experiences rather than memorized answers.  
The overall conversation was positive and comfortable.

However, I couldn’t make it to the final selection list.

❌ **Outcome:** Rejected after HR Round

## 🌟 Overall Experience  

The entire process was **smooth and learning-oriented**.  
The interviewers were polite and gave enough time to think through each question.  
Although I didn’t get selected, the experience helped me understand **where I need to improve**, especially in **communication and confidence** while explaining my thoughts.

## 💡 Advice for Others  

- **Focus on LeetCode practice:**  
  Solve medium-level DSA problems regularly, especially **sliding window**, **two-pointer**, and **hash map** based patterns.  

- **Be honest on your resume:**  
  Only include projects and technologies you’ve **actually worked on**, because interviewers go deep into them.  

- **Prepare HR questions thoughtfully:**  
  Instead of copying answers online, **reflect on your own experiences** and frame genuine responses.  

- **Work on your introduction:**  
  A confident and well-structured intro sets a positive tone for the whole interview.
