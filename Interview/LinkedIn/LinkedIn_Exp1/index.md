# 💼 Interview Experience – LinkedIn SWE Intern (Off-Campus)

**Type:** Off-Campus Opportunity  
**Role:** Software Engineer Intern (SWE Intern)  
**Total Rounds:** 3 (Online Assessment + Technical Interview + HR Interview)

---

## 🧮 Round 1 – Online Assessment  

**No. of Questions:** 3  
**Duration:** 1.5 hours  
**Topics Covered:** Graphs, Dynamic Programming (DP), Arrays  

The **Online Assessment** tested fundamental problem-solving and time management skills.  
Each question required both **logical reasoning and optimization**.  
Typical patterns included **graph traversal**, **DP state design**, and **array manipulation**.  

🧠 *Preparation Tip:*  
Practice problems from [LeetCode Graph section](https://leetcode.com/tag/graph/) and [Dynamic Programming section](https://leetcode.com/tag/dynamic-programming/) to get comfortable with the question style.  

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 1

## ⚙️ Round 2 – Technical Interview  

**Duration:** 1 hour  
**Topics Covered:** Graphs, Linked Lists, OOPs, DBMS  

The interview began with **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** fundamentals.  
I was asked about the **four core principles (Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction)** and then shown a **code snippet** using **polymorphism and inheritance** to predict the output.  
📘 You can brush up on this here: [OOP Concepts in C++ – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-oops-concept-in-cpp/)

Then the interviewer moved to **DBMS** concepts — focusing mainly on **ACID properties** and **transaction isolation levels**.

### 🧩 Coding Section  

The technical part included two **medium-level DSA questions** — one from **Graphs** and another from **Linked Lists**.  

**1️⃣ Graph Problem:**  
It was a **scenario-based question** (not direct), somewhat similar in logic to [Rotting Oranges](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotting-oranges/) but with additional constraints.  
I began by clarifying **edge cases**, then proposed a **brute-force solution** and optimized it for **space complexity**.  
I discussed **time vs space trade-offs** during the coding process, which kept it interactive.  

**2️⃣ Linked List Problem:**  
This question focused on **traversal and pointer manipulation**.  
I clearly explained my **approach**, did a **dry run**, and coded confidently.  
When the interviewer suggested an alternative optimization, I explained **why it could fail for certain edge cases**, which left a good impression.  

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Technical Round

## 🗣️ Round 3 – HR Interview  

**Duration:** 45–50 minutes  

This round was a mix of **project discussion and behavioral questions**.  
The first **25–30 minutes** were spent on my **projects**, discussing “why, what, and how” behind them.  
The interviewer asked:  
- “Why did you use this framework over others?”  
- “How did you implement authentication?” *(I used Firebase)*  
- “What was your specific contribution in team projects?”  
- “What technologies did you explore during college?”  
- “Describe your current tech stack.”  

The last **15–20 minutes** included **situational HR questions**, such as:  
- “If someone in your team isn’t contributing, how would you handle it?”  
- “How do you deal with challenges and time pressure?”  
- “Tell me about a time you showed leadership.”  

This round tested **communication, ownership, and collaboration skills**, core values for LinkedIn interns.  

✅ **Outcome:** Selected for LinkedIn SWE Internship

## 🌟 Overall Experience  

It was a **very positive and smooth process**.  
The interviewers were friendly, professional, and genuinely interested in understanding my problem-solving mindset.  
Even for candidates who didn’t make it, **LinkedIn followed up with future opportunities**, which reflects their **great candidate experience policy**.

## 💡 Advice for Others  

- **Don’t treat interviews like vivas:**  
  Talk through your thought process, and check with the interviewer if you’re headed in the right direction.  

- **Ask clarifying questions:**  
  Always confirm **edge cases** and **constraints**, this shows maturity and thoroughness.  

- **Be confident in your unique solution:**  
  Interviewers often have a specific approach in mind, but if your logic is sound and efficient, **stick to it confidently**.  

- **Keep it conversational:**  
  Think of the interview as a **discussion, not an exam**, it helps you stay calm and engaged.
