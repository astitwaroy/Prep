This was a technical round focused on problem-solving.  
The main question was **similar to [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/description/)**.  
I first discussed the approach step-by-step with the interviewer, and then coded it using **clear variable names and proper comments**, as Google values clean and well-structured code.  
After that, I was asked **two follow-up questions** related to optimizing or modifying the solution.
