# 💼 Interview Experience – Microsoft SDE

**Type:** On-Campus Opportunity  
**Role:** Software Development Engineer (SDE)  
**Total Rounds:** 2 (Technical + HR/Managerial)

---

## ⚙️ Round 1 – Technical Interview  

The first round mainly focused on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, a few **Computer Networks fundamentals**, and a brief **personal introduction**.  

The interviewer began by asking about my college experience — particularly my roles and responsibilities in various technical clubs. I shared my leadership experiences and mentioned the technical website I developed during college, which helped set a friendly and confident tone for the interview.  

### 🧩 Coding Questions  

**1️⃣ Implement a Queue using Stacks and a Stack using Queues**  
I started with the standard implementation and clearly explained the **time and space complexity**.  
Then, the interviewer asked me to **optimize it** using an **OOP-based approach** to achieve constant-time operations.  
Initially, I struggled a bit but later reasoned through different strategies and successfully designed a more efficient solution. The interviewer appreciated my problem-solving process and persistence.  

**2️⃣ 0/1 Knapsack Problem (Dynamic Programming)**  
The next question was a **DP-based problem** — implementing the **0/1 Knapsack**.  
I chose to solve it using **memoization**, explaining each **state transition** clearly.  
Although my first attempt had a small bug, I quickly debugged and fixed it, demonstrating my structured thought process and attention to detail.  

### 🌐 Computer Networks Questions  

After the coding section, the interviewer asked some conceptual questions from **Computer Networks**, such as:  
- “How does the Internet work?”  
- “When you type *google.com*, how does it get converted into an IP address?”  
- “What is Network Address Translation (NAT)?”  

I explained concepts like **DNS resolution**, **IP addressing**, and **NAT** with clarity and confidence.  
The interviewer was satisfied with my understanding and articulation.  

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 1

## 🗣️ Round 2 – HR / Managerial Interview  

This round was conducted by a **Senior Manager** and focused on **behavioral**, **project-based**, and **team-related** discussions.  

The interviewer began by asking about my **resume projects**, especially my **robotics project** with the **NITS Yantranav team**, where I worked on an **autonomous drone**.  

She asked:  
- “What were the main challenges you faced while working on this project?”  
- “How did you handle team conflicts or technical issues?”  
- “Can you describe a situation where you had to take initiative?”  

I explained how we faced issues during the **sensor integration** phase and how I coordinated with teammates to solve them effectively through communication and collaboration.  

Then, she shifted focus to my **Machine Learning project**, asking:  
- “What motivated you to choose this project?”  
- “What were your key takeaways from it?”  
- “How does it connect to real-world applications?”  

I discussed the project’s objective, the **ML model used**, and what I learned about **data handling, optimization**, and **practical implementation**.  

The round ended with **behavioral questions** around teamwork, problem-solving, and adaptability.  
The interviewer also shared valuable insights about how Microsoft emphasizes **collaboration**, **continuous learning**, and a **growth mindset**.  

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 2
