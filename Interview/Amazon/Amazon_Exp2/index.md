---

## 🧮 Round 1 – Online Assessment (MCQs)

The first round was an **Online Assessment** consisting mainly of **Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs)**.  
These tested **Computer Science fundamentals**, **logic**, and **basic programming skills**.  
It was a **shortlisting round** for the next assessment.  

📘 To prepare for this kind of assessment, revise key topics like **OOP, DBMS, and OS basics**:  
- [OOP Concepts – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-oops-concept-in-java/)  
- [DBMS Interview Questions – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dbms-interview-questions/)  
- [Operating System Interview Topics – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-systems/)  

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 1

## 🧩 Round 2 – Advanced Online Assessment  

The second assessment included **four sections**, testing both **technical** and **behavioral** abilities.  
It had:  
- **DSA-based coding problems**  
- **Aptitude and reasoning**  
- **Work simulation tasks**  
- **Behavioral questions** based on Amazon’s [**Leadership Principles**](https://www.aboutamazon.com/about-us/leadership-principles)  

These behavioral sections are crucial since Amazon evaluates cultural fit alongside technical skills.

## ⚙️ Round 3 – Technical Interview  

This final round focused purely on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**.  
The interviewer asked **two coding questions**, without any CS fundamentals or HR questions.  

### 🧩 Coding Questions  

**1️⃣ Search in a Rotated Sorted Array**  
I discussed both the **linear** and **binary search-based** approaches and implemented the optimized version in `O(log n)` time.  
📘 Practice here: [Search in Rotated Sorted Array – LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/)  

**2️⃣ House Robber Problem**  
I explained the **Dynamic Programming (DP)** approach — starting with recursion, then optimizing using tabulation.  
I also discussed time and space complexity trade-offs clearly.  
💡 Reference: [House Robber – LeetCode Problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/)  

Both solutions were correct and well-explained within the time frame.  

✅ **Outcome:** Selected after the Technical Interview  

---

## 🌟 Overall Experience  

It was a **smooth and technical process**, focused mainly on **coding efficiency**, **clarity of explanation**, and **problem-solving structure**.  
The questions were standard and fair, and the communication with the interviewer was open and professional.
