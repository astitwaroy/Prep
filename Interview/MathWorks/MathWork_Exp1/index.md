## 👨‍💼 Round 2 – Managerial Round

This round lasted for **around 40 minutes**.  
We started with a detailed discussion about my **projects**, followed by **HR-style questions** related to teamwork and challenges, such as:  
- “Tell me about a situation where you had a conflict with your teammates.”  
- “Was your project individual or group-based?”  
- “What kind of technical challenges did you face?”  

The interviewer also asked me about the **EDG program** and what I knew about it (as discussed in the PPT).  
I explained my understanding of how EDG provides exposure to various engineering domains before specialization.

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 2

## 💻 Round 3 – Technical Interview

This was the most **comprehensive and challenging** round, lasting about **1 hour**.  
It began with a short discussion about one of my **projects** and then moved into coding and core CS topics.

### 🧩 Coding Section

The interviewer asked me to choose **two programming languages** — I selected **C** and **C++**.

Two DSA questions were asked:  
1️⃣ **Array Problem (Easy Level)** – A simple logical question testing array manipulation.  
2️⃣ **Graph Problem (Medium Level)** – Similar to the [**Number of Islands** problem](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/) on LeetCode.  
I solved it using **DFS**, then discussed optimizing the **space complexity**.

### ⚙️ Conceptual & Theoretical Questions

Then came a series of **C/C++ fundamentals** questions:  
- Difference between **C and C++**  
- OOP topics like **function overriding**, **overloading**, **hiding**, **access modifiers**, and **virtual functions**  
- Explained the **diamond problem** and solutions using **virtual inheritance**

The interviewer gave me a **C++ code snippet** based on **function overriding** and asked for the **output and explanation**.  
You can review a similar concept here: [Function Overriding in C++ – GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-overriding-in-cpp/).

There was also a C code snippet to analyze the **output and reasoning**.

### 🧠 Operating System Questions

Questions included:  
- **Process State Diagram**  
- **Layout of PCB (Process Control Block)**  
- **Four Conditions of Deadlock**

Reference: [Deadlock in Operating Systems – GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-of-deadlock-in-operating-system/)

I answered everything except the detailed reasoning for one C code output.  

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared Round 3

- “How do you deal with challenges?”  
- “How do you manage time under tight deadlines?”  
- “Tell me about a situation where you showed leadership in a team.”  

They also revisited the **EDG role** discussion to check my understanding and motivation for it.  
The interviewer was friendly and encouraging throughout the session.

✅ **Outcome:** Cleared HR Round

## 💡 Advice for Others  

- **Focus on Core CS Fundamentals:**  
  Especially **OOP** (in C++ or Java), **Operating Systems**, and **basic DSA** problems.  
  ➜ Brush up topics from [GeeksforGeeks – OOP Concepts](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-oops-concept-in-java/).

- **Pay attention to the PPT:**  
  Questions about the company or the **EDG program** can come directly from it.  

- **In GDs:**  
  Keep your points **short, confident, and fluent**, avoid dominating and let others speak too.
